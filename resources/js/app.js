// 1. Define route components.
// These can be imported from other files
const Home = { template: '<div>Home</div>' }
const Dashboard = { template: '<div>Dashboard</div>' }

// 2. Define some routes
// Each route should map to a component. The "component" can
// either be an actual component constructor created via
// `Vue.extend()`, or just a component options object.
// We'll talk about nested routes later.

const routes = [
  { path: '/Home', component: Home },
  { path: '/Dashboard', component: Dashboard }
]

// 3. Create the router instance and pass the `routes` option
// You can pass in additional options here, but let's
// keep it simple for now.

const router = new VueRouter({
    routes: routes,
})

// 4. Create and mount the root instance.
// Make sure to inject the router with the router option to make the
// whole app router-aware.

const app = new Vue({
  router : router
}).$mount('#app')

// Now the app has started!
